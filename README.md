# Accident Detection



This is a project for detecting road accidents using computer vision and machine learning techniques. This system use a variety of sensors, such as accelerometers and GPS to detect and analyze data related to accidents, such as changes in speed, direction, and impact force. The ultimate goal of accident detection systems is to minimize response times and improve outcomes for those involved in accidents. The key challenges in developing effective accident detection systems include ensuring accuracy and reliability of detection, minimizing false positives, and ensuring compatibility with existing emergency response infrastructure.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have the following software installed:


Flutter SDK

Android Studio

TensorFlow 2.0 or higher


## Features
Accelerometer and Gyroscope sensors: The app uses the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors in a mobile device to detect sudden changes in speed or direction that may indicate a car accident.

Emergency Alert: If a car accident is detected, the app automatically sends an emergency alert to pre-configured emergency contacts with the user's location information and a message indicating that an accident has occurred.
